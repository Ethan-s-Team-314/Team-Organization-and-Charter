Objective:
---

The objective of this assignment is to brainstorm unique design features for our product and to provide the client with alternating versions of the product. The ideas are in respect to the project requirements.

---
Project Description:
---

The project requires us to design a modular system using UART communication between individually developed subsystems. Each team member will create a surface-mount PCB, and the overall system must integrate seamlessly for the Innovation Showcase. I understand the importance of individual contributions, team collaboration, and adherence to technical guidelines, such as using specified microcontrollers, designing with approved ECAD tools, and following the daisy-chain communication protocol. Our success depends on careful planning, regular testing, and meeting the documentation and integration requirements laid out in the course.

Our Intentions with the Science Exhibits:
---

1. The goal of your exhibit.

The weather monitoring system exhibit aims to demonstrate physical phenomena related to meteorological data collection. Primary objectives include teaching students how environmental sensors function, focusing visitor attention on scientific measurement processes, and facilitating understanding of cause-effect relationships in weather systems. The exhibit will help students comprehend how various instruments collect, analyze, and visualize atmospheric data through interactive, hands-on experiences.


2. Your audience.


The exhibit targets K-12 students with diverse learning characteristics. This audience spans multiple age groups (approximately 6-16 years), includes varying physical sizes, encompasses different learning styles, and represents varied levels of scientific understanding. The design must accommodate these variations by creating an interactive experience that is simultaneously accessible to younger elementary students and intellectually engaging for high school learners, ensuring inclusive educational accessibility.

---
Address the following questions derived from the readings on science exhibits:
---

1. What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?

There are various types of cues that our team is considering. One of the most important cues would be visual. The most important part from customers' points of view would be how appealing the device is. Students would mostly be attracted to the design of the device. We would also think about the tactile cues where we will utilize different textures and shapes for buttons and handles that indicate their function, along those with visual impairments or younger children.

2. How do you plan on designing your "controls" (Refer to pages 4 and 6 of "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")?

For designing the controls, we plan to go for simplicity. Design controls that are simple and require minimal explanation, such as large push buttons for operations and touchscreen interfaces with drag-and-drop features.

3. What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?

All the 3 factors play an important role while designing the product. Building parts using robust materials that can withstand repeated use and potential misuse. Safety is our priority factor while designing the product. We are thinking of including emergency stop buttons where necessary and ensuring all electrical components are well insulated and meet safety standards.

4. What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device? (Refer to page 5 of "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits"

We are planning to have on-device instruction, provide concise, clear instructions on the device itself, possibly through diagrams or short phrases directly next to control elements. We may also include some interactive tutorials so that it can be super helpful to the students.

5. Ideas or strategies for avoiding each of the five common pitfalls mentioned in ("Designing Science Museum Exhibits with Multiple Interactive Features: Five Common Pitfalls")
* Not Overloading with more and more information
* Gathering more and more feedback
* Getting to know about the customers need in detail
* Not Neglecting Conceptual Consistency
* Failing to capture Interest

Our description of the Weather Monitoring System:
---

Describe, in one page:

* How the features highlighted in your concept sketch satisfy the needs of museum visitors.
* How the functionality will will be split across four teammates (See the project description)
* Internet-based two-way communication
* Human machine interface via a screen and buttons
* Sensor and Actuator-based controlled response

In this passage, please also use the two readings on science exhibits to justify how your concept satisfies the following questions:

1. What kinds of cues will you provide to make the use of your device easier?
2. How do you plan on designing your "controls" (see pages 4 and 6 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits")
3. What role will durability, safety, and comfort play in the user experience?
4. What kind of instruction will be needed to use the device? (see page 5 of the pdf for "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits").

The weather monitoring system concept sketched for the museum integrates various features to cater to the needs of its visitors. We will use the ESP32 board as the primary controller that processes data from several sensors and modules. The LCD display prominently showcases real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall, making the information accessible and engaging for visitors This is meant to present immediate feedback for customers interested in weather patterns.

Functionality is distributed among four teammates. One will focus on hardware assembly and wiring, ensuring the secure connection of sensors and components to the ESP32 board and organizing the wiring efficiently. The second teammate will handle software development, writing the code necessary to read data from the sensors and display it on the LCD. This involves interfacing the ESP32 with the sensors and ensuring real-time data updates. The third teammate will design the user interface, selecting fonts, colors, and layouts to make the LCD display intuitive and easy to read. The fourth teammate will test and calibrate the system, running it under various conditions to ensure accuracy and reliability. All teammates will also have to follow the instructions following the individual subsystems, this is so that the requirements for individual PCBs are ensured.

Internet-based two-way communication is integrated into the system, allowing it to receive updates and send data to remote servers for further analysis or display on a web interface. This feature enables continuous monitoring and provides customers with up-to-date information. This should be done with the capabilities embedded in the esp32, such as Bluetooth feedback and Wi-Fi.

The human-machine interface is achieved through a combination of the LCD screen and user-friendly buttons. The interface is designed with cues such as clear labels and color-coded buttons to guide visitors. For instance, buttons are used to switch between different data displays or reset the sensors. According to the "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits," controls are designed to be straightforward, with minimal steps required for interaction. The connections between the systems should be straightforward and the LCD screen should not use any engineering lingo but easy-to-understand text about real-time data.

Durability is a key consideration in the design, as the system must withstand frequent use and potential environmental factors. High-quality components and robust construction ensure longevity, and the system is enclosed in a sturdy case to protect it from physical damage. Safety is prioritized by properly insulating electrical components and securely mounting sensors to prevent any accidents. As this equipment is meant to be used outside and sometimes to measure rainfall, this device needs to withstand the elements in harsh scenarios. Comfort is addressed through the ergonomic design of controls and the portable structure of the system, making it easy for visitors to handle and interact with.

Instructions for using the device are simple and clear, as recommended on page 5 of the "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits." Customers are guided through simple steps for powering the system, reading data on the LCD display, and interpreting weather information. As we are the ones who have designed the system, we should also be the ones to understand its troubleshooting.

The weather monitoring system is built to enhance a customer’s experience by providing an interactive and informative product. By addressing user needs and adhering to best practices in exhibit design, the system offers a valuable tool for learning about weather science in an engaging and accessible manner.
