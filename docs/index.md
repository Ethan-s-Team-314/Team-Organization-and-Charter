## Summary

Our team is tasked with developing a weather monitoring system that reads temperature and humidity while filtering out any excess water from the sytem using a motor. The product is meant to be versatile and update values online rapidly and via HMI in the physical product. This device is meant to serve any purpose it may help fulfill but specifically may help archicultrual purposes in crop water exposure and temperature setting, due to the device filtering out water, the device may be self reliant and not have to be reparied constantly. This device may also aid in teaching k-12 students on how sensors operate and the flow chart system of how to create such a device. It may inspire students and spark creativity in developing some of their own devices via a flow chart or even their own physcial product without delving to deep into circuit design.
