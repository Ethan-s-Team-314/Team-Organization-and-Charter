We will use the ESP32 board as the primary controller that processes data from several sensors and modules. The LCD display prominently showcases real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and rainfall, making the information accessible and engaging for visitors This is meant to present immediate feedback for customers interested in weather patterns.</p> <p>Functionality is distributed among four teammates. One will focus on hardware assembly and wiring, ensuring the secure connection of sensors and components to the ESP32 board and organizing the wiring efficiently. The second teammate will handle software development, writing the code necessary to read data from the sensors and display it on the LCD. This involves interfacing the ESP32 with the sensors and ensuring real-time data updates. The third teammate will design the user interface, selecting fonts, colors, and layouts to make the LCD display intuitive and easy to read. The fourth teammate will test and calibrate the system, running it under various conditions to ensure accuracy and reliability. All teammates will also have to follow the instructions following the individual subsystems, this is so that the requirements for individual PCBs are ensured.</p> <p>Internet-based two-way communication is integrated into the system, allowing it to receive updates and send data to remote servers for further analysis or display on a web interface. This feature enables continuous monitoring and provides customers with up-to-date information. This should be done with the capabilities embedded in the esp32, such as Bluetooth feedback and Wi-Fi.</p> <p>The human-machine interface is achieved through a combination of the LCD screen and user-friendly buttons. The interface is designed with cues such as clear labels and color-coded buttons to guide visitors. For instance, buttons are used to switch between different data displays or reset the sensors. According to the \"Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits,\" controls are designed to be straightforward, with minimal steps required for interaction. The connections between the systems should be straightforward and the LCD screen should not use any engineering lingo but easy-to-understand text about real-time data.</p> <p>Durability is a key consideration in the design, as the system must withstand frequent use and potential environmental factors. High-quality components and robust construction ensure longevity, and the system is enclosed in a sturdy case to protect it from physical damage. Safety is prioritized by properly insulating electrical components and securely mounting sensors to prevent any accidents. As this equipment is meant to be used outside and sometimes to measure rainfall, this device needs to withstand the elements in harsh scenarios. Comfort is addressed through the ergonomic design of controls and the portable structure of the system, making it easy for visitors to handle and interact with.</p> <p>Instructions for using the device are simple and clear, as recommended on page 5 of the \"Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits.\" Customers are guided through simple steps for powering the system, reading data on the LCD display, and interpreting weather information. As we are the ones who have designed the system, we should also be the ones to understand its troubleshooting.</p> <p>The weather monitoring system is built to enhance a customer\u2019s experience by providing an interactive and informative product. By addressing user needs and adhering to best practices in exhibit design, the system offers a valuable tool for learning about weather science in an engaging and accessible manner.</p>"},{"location":"Ideation%20and%20Concept%20Generation/#presentation","title":"Presentation","text":"<p>Presentation</p> <p>Youtube Video</p>"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/1.%20Block%20Diagram/","title":"1.

For example, if you are using the <code>tex-chtml.js</code> component, then you can remove the <code>tex-mml-chtml.js</code>, <code>tex-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-mml-svg.js</code>, <code>tex-chtml-full.js</code>, and <code>tex-svg-full.js</code> configurations, which will save considerable space.  Indeed, you should be able to remove everything other than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>, and the <code>input/tex/extensions</code>, <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code>, <code>adaptors</code>, <code>a11y</code>, and <code>sre</code> directories.  If you are using the results only on the web, you can remove <code>adaptors</code> as well.</p> <p>If you are not using A11Y support (e.g., speech generation, or semantic enrichment), then you can remove <code>a11y</code> and <code>sre</code> as well (though in this case you may need to disable the assistive tools in the MathJax contextual menu in order to avoid MathJax trying to load them when they aren't there).</p> <p>If you are using SVG rather than CommonHTML output (e.g., <code>tex-svg.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), you can remove the <code>output/chtml/fonts/woff-v2</code> directory.  If you are using MathML input rather than TeX (e.g., <code>mml-chtml.js</code> rather than <code>tex-chtml.js</code>), then you can remove <code>input/tex/extensions</code> as well.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#the-component-files-and-pull-requests","title":"The Component Files and Pull Requests","text":"<p>The <code>es5</code> directory is generated automatically from the contents of the MathJax source repository.
